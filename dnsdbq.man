.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm dnsdbq
constructs and issues queries to the Farsight DNSDB and displays
responses. It is commonly used as a production command line interface
to the DNSDB API server. Its default query type is a "lookup" query.
As an option, it can issue a "summarize" query type.
.Pp
DNSDB is a database that stores and indexes both the passive DNS data
available via Farsight Security's Security Information Exchange as well as the
authoritative DNS data that various zone operators make available. DNSDB makes
it easy to search for individual DNS RRsets and provides additional metadata
for search results such as first seen and last seen timestamps as well as the
DNS bailiwick associated with an RRset. DNSDB also has the ability to perform
inverse or rdata searches.
.Pp
You'll need to get an API key from Farsight to use
.Ic dnsdbq
with DNSDB.
.Pp
Farsight's passive DNS infrastructure performs a complex process
of "bailiwick reconstruction" where an RRset's position within the DNS
hierarchy is approximated. This serves two purposes:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
Provide context of the location of a given DNS record within the DNS hierarchy
.It
Prevent "untrustworthy" records that are a result of intentional or
unintentional cache poisoning attempts from being replicated by downstream
consumers.
.El
.Pp
For example, given the fully qualified domain name
.Ic www.dachshund.example.com ,
valid bailiwicks would be
.Ic dachshund.example.com ,
.Ic example.com ,
or
.Ic com .
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Fl A Ar timestamp
Specify a "time_first_after" timestamp. Only results first seen by the
Farsight sensor network on or after this date will be emitted. See below for
timestamp formats and examples.
.It Fl B Ar timestamp
Specify a "time_first_before" timestamp. Only results first seen by the
Farsight sensor network on or before this date will be emitted. See below for
timestamp formats and examples.
.It Fl b Ar bailiwick
specify bailiwick (only valid with
.Fl r
queries).  If bailiwick is specified, but rrtype is not specified, then a default rrtype of ANY will be used.
.It Fl c
by default, -A and -B (separately or together) will select partial overlaps of
database tuples and time search criteria. To match only complete overlaps, add
the -c ("completeness") command line option (this is also known as "strict"
mode).
.It Fl d
enable debug mode.  Repeat for more debug output.
.It Fl f
specify batch lookup mode allowing one or more queries to be performed.
Queries will be read from standard input and are expected to be be in
one of the following formats:
.Bl -dash -offset indent
.It
RRset query:
.Ic rrset/name/NAME[/RRTYPE[/BAILIWICK]]
.It
Rdata (name) query:
.Ic rdata/name/NAME[/RRTYPE]
.It
Rdata (IP address) query:
.Ic rdata/ip/ADDR[,PFXLEN]
.It
Rdata (raw) query:
.Ic rdata/raw/HEX-PAIRS[/RRTYPE]
.El
.Pp
This option cannot be mixed with
.Fl n ,
.Fl r ,
.Fl R ,
or
.Fl i .
An example of how to use
.Fl f
is below.
.It Fl g
return graveled results.  Default is to return aggregated results (rocks,
vs. gravel).  Gravel is a feature for providing Volume Across Time.
.It Fl h
emit usage and quit.
.It Fl I
request information from the API server concerning the API key itself, which
may include rate limit, query quota, query allowance, or privilege levels; the
output format and content is dependent on the server_sys argument (see
.Ic -u
) and upon the
.Fl p
argument.
.Ic -I -p json
prints the raw info.
.Ic -I -p text
prints
the information in a more understandable textual form, including converting
any epoch integer times into UTC formatted times.
.It Fl i Ar ip
specify rdata ip ("right-hand side") query.  The value is one of an
IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, an IPv4 network with prefix length, an
IPv4 address range, or an IPv6 network with prefix length. If a
network lookup is being performed, the delimiter between network
address and prefix length is a single comma (",") character rather
than the usual slash ("/") character to avoid clashing with the HTTP
URI path name separator.  Examples are below.
.It Fl J Ar input_file
opens input_file and reads newline-separated JSON objects therefrom, in
preference to -f (batch mode) or -r, -n, or -i (query mode). This can be used
to reprocess the output from a prior invocation which used
.Fl j
(-p json).  If
input_file is "-" then standard input (stdin) will be read.
.It Fl j
specify newline delimited json output mode.
.It Fl k Ar sort_keys
when sorting with -s or -S, selects one or more comma separated sort keys,
among "first", "last", "count", "name", and/or "data".
If sorting was specified, but this -k option is not specified, then will default
to sorting by first, last, count.
Each sort key may only be specified once.
.It Fl l Ar query_limit
query for that limit's number of responses. If specified as 0 then the DNSDB
API server will return the maximum limit of results allowed.  If
.Fl l ,
is not specified, then the query will not specify a limit, and the DNSDB API
server may use its default limit.
.It Fl L Ar output_limit
clamps the number of responses output to
.Ic output_limit .
The
.Fl L
output limit defaults to the
.Fl l
limit's value.
.It Fl M Ar max_count
for the summarize verb, stops summarizing when the count reaches that
max_count, which must be a positive integer.  The resulting total
count may exceed max_count as it will include the entire count from
the last rrset examined.  The default is to not constrain the maximum
count.  The number of rrsets summarized is also limited by the
query_limit.
.It Fl m
used only with
.Fl f ,
this causes all output to be merged rather than serialized, and causes up
to ten (10) API jobs to execute in parallel.
.It Fl N Ar raw-name
specify raw
.Ic rdata
data ("right-hand side") query.  The value is an even number of
hexadecimal digits specifying a raw octet string.  The "raw" wire-format encodings are standardized. The embedding of these in dnstable is documented in the
.Xr dnstable-encoding 5
manual page.
.It Fl n Ar name
specify
.Ic rdata
name ("right-hand side") query.  The value is a DNS domain name in
presentation format, or a left-hand (".example.com") or right-hand
("www.example.") wildcard domain name. Note that left-hand wildcard queries
are somewhat more expensive than right-hand wildcard queries.
.It Fl O Ar offset
to offset by #offset the results returned by the query.  
This gives you incremental results transfers.
Cannot be negative.  The default is 0.
.It Fl p Ar output_type
select output type. Specify:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm dns
for presentation output similar to that of
.Xr dig 1 .
.Cm dns
format is the default output format.
.It Cm json
for newline delimited JSON output.
.It Cm csv
for comma separated value output. This format is information losing,
since
it cannot express multiple resource records that are in a single RRset.
Instead, each resource record is expressed in a separate line of output.
.El
.Pp
See the
.Ic DNSDB_TIME_FORMAT
environment variable below for controlling how human readable
timestamps are formatted.
.It Fl q
makes the program reticent about warnings.
.It Fl R Ar raw-rrset
specify raw
.Ic rrset
owner data ("left-hand side") query.  The value is an even number of
hexadecimal digits specifying a raw octet string.
.It Fl r Ar rrset
specify rrset ("left-hand side") name query.
.It Fl s
sort output in ascending key order.
.It Fl S
sort output in descending key order.
.It Fl t Ar rrtype
specify the resource record type desired.  If present, this option
should be before any
.Fl R ,
.Fl r ,
or
.Fl n
options.  This option is not allowed if the
.Fl i
option is present.  Valid values include those defined in DNS RFCs,
including ANY.  A special-case supported in DNSDB is ANY-DNSSEC, which
matches on DS, RRSIG, NSEC, DNSKEY, NSEC3, NSEC3PARAM, and DLV
resource record types.
.It Fl u Ar server_sys
specifies the syntax of the RESTful URL, default is "dnsdb".
.It Fl V Ar verb
The verb to perform, i.e. the type of query, either "lookup" or
"summarize".  The default is the "lookup" verb.  As an option, you can
specify the "summarize" verb, which gives you an estimate of
result size.  At-a-glance, it provides information on when a given
domain name, IP address or other DNS asset was first-seen and
last-seen by the global sensor network, as well as the total
observation count.
.It Fl v
report the version of dnsdbq and exit.
.El
.Sh "TIMESTAMP FORMATS"
Timestamps may be one of following forms.
.Bl -dash -offset indent
.It
positive unsigned integer : in Unix epoch format.
.It
negative unsigned integer : negative offset in seconds from now.
.It
YYYY-MM-DD [HH:MM:SS] : in absolute form, in UTC time, as DNSDB does its
fencing using UTC time.
.It
%dw%dd%dh%dm%ds : the relative form with explicit labels.  Calculates offset
from UTC time, as DNSDB does its fencing using UTC time.
.Pp
.El
When using batch mode with the second or forth cases, using relative
times to now, the value for "now" is set when dnsdbq starts.
.Pp
A few examples of how to use timefencing options.
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
# only responses after Aug 22, 2015 (midnight)
$ dnsdbq ... -A 2015-08-22
# only responses before Jan 22, 2013 (midnight)
$ dnsdbq ... -B 2013-01-22
# only responses from 2015 (midnight to midnight)
$ dnsdbq ... -B 2016-01-01 -A 2015-01-01
# only responses after 2015-08-22 14:36:10
$ dnsdbq ... -A "2015-08-22 14:36:10"
# only responses from the last 60 minutes
$ dnsdbq ... -A "-3600"
# only responses after "just now"
$ dnsdbq -f ... -A "-3600"
# batch mode with only responses after "just now", even if feeding inputs
to dnsdbq in batch mode takes hours.
$ date +%s

$ dnsdbq ... -A 1485284066
.Ed
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
A few examples of how to specify IP address information.
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
# specify a single IPv4 address
$ dnsdbq ... -i 128.223.32.35
# specify an IPv4 CIDR
$ dnsdbq ... -i 128.223.32.0/24
# specify a range of IPv4 addresses

.Sh FILES
.Ic ~/.isc-dnsdb-query.conf ,
.Ic ~/.dnsdb-query.conf ,
.Ic /etc/isc-dnsdb-query.conf ,
or
.Ic /etc/dnsdb-query.conf :
configuration file which should contain the user's apikey and server URL.
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev DNSDB_SERVER"
.It Ev APIKEY
contains the user's apikey (no default).
.It Ev DNSDB_SERVER
contains the URL of the DNSDB API server (default is https://api.dnsdb.info),
and optionally the URI prefix for the database (default is "/lookup").
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev DNSDB_API_KEY , APIKEY"
.It Ev DNSDB_API_KEY , APIKEY
contains the user's apikey. If DNSDB_API_KEY is not present, then APIKEY will
be used. If neither variable is present, the configuration file is consulted.
.It Ev DNSDB_SERVER
contains the URL of the DNSDB API server, and optionally a URI prefix to be
used (default is "/lookup"). If not set, the configuration file is consulted.
.It Ev DNSDB_TIME_FORMAT
controls how human readable date times are displayed.  If "iso" then ISO8601
(RFC3339) format is used, for example; "2018-09-06T22:48:00Z".  If "csv" then
an Excel CSV compatible format is used; for example, "2018-09-06 22:48:00".
.El
.Sh "EXIT STATUS"
Success (exit status zero) occurs if a connection could be established
to the back end database server, even if no records matched the search
criteria. Failure (exit status nonzero) occurs if no connection could be
established, perhaps due to a network or service failure, or a configuration
error such as specifying the wrong server hostname.
