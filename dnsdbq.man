.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm dnsdbq
constructs and issues queries to the Farsight DNSDB and displays responses. It
is commonly used as a production command line interface to the DNSDB API
server.
.Pp
DNSDB is a database that stores and indexes both the passive DNS data
available via Farsight Security's Security Information Exchange as well as the
authoritative DNS data that various zone operators make available. DNSDB makes
it easy to search for individual DNS RRsets and provides additional metadata
for search results such as first seen and last seen timestamps as well as the
DNS bailiwick associated with an RRset. DNSDB also has the ability to perform
inverse or rdata searches.
.Pp
You'll need to get an API key from Farsight to use
.Ic dnsdbq
with DNSDB.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Fl A Ar timestamp
Specify a "time_first_after" timestamp. Only results first seen by the Farsight
sensor network on or after this date will be emitted. See below for timestamp formats and examples.
.It Fl B Ar timestamp
Specify a "time_first_before" timestamp. Only results first seen by the
Farsight sensor network on or before this date will be emitted. See below for timestamp formats and examples.
.It Fl b Ar bailiwick
specify bailiwick (only valid with
.Fl r
queries). Farsight's passive DNS infrastructure performs a complex process
of "bailiwick reconstruction" where an RRset's position within the DNS
hierarchy is approximated. This serves two purposes:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
Provide context of the location of a given DNS record within the DNS hierarchy
.It
Prevent "untrustworthy" records that are a result of intentional or
unintentional cache poisoning attempts from being replicated by downstream
consumers.
.El
.Pp
For example, given the fully qualified domain name
.Ic www.dachshund.example.com ,
valid bailiwics would be
.Ic dachshund.example.com ,
.Ic example.com ,
or
.Ic com .
.It Fl d
enable debug mode.
.It Fl f
specify batch lookup mode allowing one or more queries to be performed.
Queries will be read from standard input and are expected to be be in
one of the following formats:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
RRSet query:
.Ic rrset/name/NAME[/TYPE[/BAILIWICK]]
.It
Rdata (name) query:
.Ic rdata/name/NAME[/TYPE]
.It
Rdata (IP address) query:
.Ic rdata/ip/ADDR[/PFXLEN]
.El
.Pp
This option cannot be mixed with
.Fl n ,
.Fl r ,
or
.Fl i .
An example of how to use
.Fl f
is below.
.It Fl m
used only with
.Fl f ,
this causes all output to be merged rather than serialized, and causes up
to ten (10) API jobs to execute in parallel.
.It Fl h
emit usage and quit.
.It Fl i Ar ip
specify rdata ip ("right-hand side") query. Valid arguments
can an IP (v4 or v6) address, a prefix, or an IP address range. Examples are
below.
.It Fl j
specify newline delimited json output mode.
.It Fl l Ar limit
clamp the number of responses to
.Ic limit .
.It Fl u Ar server_sys
specifies the syntax of the RESTful URL, default is "dnsdb".
.It Fl n Ar name
specify
.Ic rdata
name ("right-hand side") query.
.It Fl k Ar sort_fields
when sorting with -s or -S, selects sort fields (first, last, and/or count).
.It Fl p Ar output_type
select output type. Specify
.Ic csv
for comma separated value output,
.Ic dns
for presentation output similar to that of dig(1), or
.Ic json
for newline delimited json output.
.It Fl r Ar rdata
specify rrset ("left-hand side") query.
.It Fl t Ar type
specify type of rdata query and how
.Ic value
specifies how the target value should be interpreted. Should be one of the
following:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
.Ic name :
The
.Ic value
is a DNS domain name in presentation format, or a left-hand (".example.com")
or right-hand ("www.example.") wildcard domain name. Note that left-hand
wildcard queries are somewhat more expensive than right-hand wildcard queries.
.It
.Ic ip :
The
.Ic value
is one of an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, an IPv4 network with prefix length,
or an IPv6 network with prefix length. If a network lookup is being performed,
the delimiter between network address and prefix length is a single comma (",")
character rather than the usual slash ("/") character to avoid clashing with
the HTTP URI path name separator.
.It
.Ic raw :
The
.Ic value
is an even number of hexadecimal digits specifying a raw octet string.
.El
.It Fl J Ar input_file
opens input_file and reads newline-separated JSON objects therefrom, in
preference to -f (batch mode) or -r, -n, or -i (query mode). This can be
used to reprocess the output from a prior invocation which used -j (-p json).
.It Fl h
display help text.
.It Fl s
sort output in date-time order.
.It Fl S
sort output in reverse date-time order.
.It Fl c
by default, -A and -B (separately or together) will select partial overlaps of
database tuples and time search criteria. To match only complete overlaps, add
the -c ("completeness") command line option (this is also known as "strict"
mode).
.It Fl I
request information from the API server concerning the API key itself, which
may include rate limit, query quota, query allowance, or privilege levels; the
output format and content is dependent on the server_sys argument (see -u) and
upon the -p argument.  -I -p json prints the raw info.  -I -p text prints
the information in a more understandable textual form, including converting
any epoch integer times into UTC formatted times.
.El
.Sh TIMESTAMPS FORMATS
Timestamps may be one of following forms.
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
positive unsigned integer : in Unix epoch format.
.It
negative unsigned integer : negative offset in seconds from now.
.It
YYYY-MM-DD [HH:MM:SS] : in absolute form, in the local time (zone), but DNSDB does its fencing using UTC time.  You should adjust your timestamps appropriately.
.It
%dw%dd%dh%dm%ds : the relative form with explicit labels.  Calculates offsite from the local time, but DNSDB does its fencing using UTC time.  You should adjust your timestamps appropriately.
.Pp
.El
A few examples of how to use timefencing options.
.Bd -literal -offset 4n

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
A few examples of how to specify IP address information.
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
# specify a single IPv4 address
$ dnsdbq ... -i 128.223.32.35
