This is a pure C99 program that accesses passive DNS database systems such as:
	* the DNSDB API server at Farsight Security
	* the CIRCL pDNS server at Computer Incident Response Center (LU)

An API key is required for operation. The command syntax was inspired by a
python script called dnsdb_query, but significant departure has occured,
largely inspired by a modern understanding of "time fencing" and a desire for
new features such as CSV output and JSON reprocessing.

Dependencies:
	jansson (2.5 or later)
	libcurl (7.28 or later)
	modern compiler (clang or GCC)

On Linux (Debian 8):
	apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
	apt-get install libjansson-dev

On Linux (CentOS 6):
	# Based on PHP instructions for installing libcurl...
	wget http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.28.1.tar.gz
	tar xvzf curl-7.28.1.tar.gz
	cd curl-7.28.1/
	./configure --with-libssh2 --enable-ares=/usr/local/ --enable-ipv6
	make
	make install

	# lib jansson
	wget http://www.digip.org/jansson/releases/jansson-2.5.tar.gz
	tar -xpzf jansson-2.5.tar.gz
	cd jansson-2.5
	./configure
	make
	make install

	echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf
	ldconfig

On FreeBSD 10:
	pkg install curl jansson

On macOS:
	brew install jansson

        If you want an almost static dnsdbq binary on macOS, that
        is, one without any non-System library dependencies, you can
        rebuild dnsdbq with a static jansson library.  That binary
        could then be deployed on any identical macOS version and
        architecture.

        1. Find the static jansson library, probably
           /usr/local/lib/libjansson.a as installed by brew.
        2. Change the Makefile's line
              JANSLIBS = -L/usr/local/lib -ljansson
           to instead specify the static library location, probably to:
              JANSLIBS = /usr/local/lib/libjansson.a
        3. Then run make

Getting Started
	Add the API key to ~/.dnsdb-query.conf in the below given format,
	APIKEY="YOURAPIKEYHERE"

	If you don't have an API key, you may qualify for a free one:
