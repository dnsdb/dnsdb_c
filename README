This is a pure C99 program that accesses passive DNS database systems such as:
    * the DNSDB API server at Farsight Security
    * the CIRCL pDNS server at Computer Incident Response Center (LU)

An API key is required for operation. The command syntax was inspired by a
python script called dnsdb_query, but significant departure has occured,
largely inspired by a modern understanding of "time fencing" and a desire for
new features such as CSV output and JSON reprocessing.

Dependencies needed:
    jansson (2.5 or later)
    libcurl (7.28 or later)
    modern compiler (clang or GCC)

Installing dependencies:

    On Debian 8 Linux:
	apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
	apt-get install libjansson-dev

    On CentOS 6 Linux:
	# Based on PHP instructions for installing libcurl...
	wget http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.28.1.tar.gz
	tar xvzf curl-7.28.1.tar.gz
	cd curl-7.28.1/
	./configure --with-libssh2 --enable-ares=/usr/local/ --enable-ipv6
	make
	make install

	# lib jansson
	wget http://www.digip.org/jansson/releases/jansson-2.5.tar.gz
	tar -xpzf jansson-2.5.tar.gz
	cd jansson-2.5
	./configure
	make
	make install

	echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf
	ldconfig

    On CentOS 7 Linux:
	yum install libcurl-devel.x86_64
	yum install jansson-devel.x86_64
	yum install centos-release-scl
	yum install devtoolset-8
	scl enable devtoolset-8 bash
	# do the build from that bash

    On CentOS 8 Linux:
	dnf install gcc
	dnf install jansson.x86_64 jansson-devel.x86_64
	dnf install libcurl-devel.x86_64

    On FreeBSD 10:
	pkg install curl jansson

    On macOS:
	brew install jansson

Building and installing:

    (Assumes you have "git")

    git clone https://github.com/dnsdb/dnsdbq.git
    cd dnsdbq
    make install clean

    On macOS, if you want an almost static dnsdbq binary on macOS,
    that is, one without any non-System library dependencies, you can
    rebuild dnsdbq with a static jansson library.  That binary could
    then be deployed on any identical macOS version and architecture.

	1. Find the static jansson library, probably
	   /usr/local/lib/libjansson.a as installed by brew.
	2. Change the Makefile's line
		JANSLIBS = -L/usr/local/lib -ljansson
	    to instead specify the static library location, probably to:
		JANSLIBS = /usr/local/lib/libjansson.a
	3. Then run make

Getting Started
    Add the API key to ~/.dnsdb-query.conf in the below given format,
    APIKEY="YOURAPIKEYHERE"

    If you don't have an API key, you may qualify for a free one:
