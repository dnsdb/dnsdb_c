This is a pure C program that accesses passive DNS database systems such as:
	* the DNSDB API server at Farsight Security
	* the CIRCL pDNS server at Computer Incident Response Center (LU)

An API key is required for operation. The command syntax was inspired by a
python script called dnsdb_query, but significant departure has occured,
largely inspired by a modern understanding of "time fencing" and a desire for
new features such as CSV output and JSON reprocessing.

Dependencies:
	jansson (2.5 or later)
	libcurl (7.28 or later)

On Linux (Debian 8):
	apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
	apt-get install libjansson-dev

On Linux (CentOS 6):
	# Based on PHP instructions for installing libcurl...
	wget http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.28.1.tar.gz
	tar xvzf curl-7.28.1.tar.gz
	cd curl-7.28.1/
	./configure --with-libssh2 --enable-ares=/usr/local/ --enable-ipv6
	make
	make install

	# lib jansson
	wget http://www.digip.org/jansson/releases/jansson-2.5.tar.gz
	tar -xpzf jansson-2.5.tar.gz
	cd jansson-2.5
	./configure
	make
	make install

	echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf
	ldconfig

On FreeBSD 10:

On OSX:
	brew install jansson

Usage notes:
	If your rrname, bailiwick or rdata contains the '/' character you
	will need to specify -t and/or -b options on the command line, e.g.:
	
	./dnsdbq -t ptr -r 1.0/1.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa
	
	Note that this is currently order-dependent (-t and -b must be first).

Getting Started
	Add the API key to ~/.dnsdb-query.conf in the below given format,
	APIKEY="YOURAPIKEYHERE"
